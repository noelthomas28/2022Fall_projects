Group 5: Examination of Health Data Breaches Study

Ivory Chorng, Noel Thomas

We looked at a study on data breaches in the United States (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4272442/) and 
wanted to improve it. The authorâ€™s data was acquired from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service, Office for 
Civil Rights (https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf Links to an external site.). The page includes 
breaches reported within the last 24 months (when the study was done, which is 2013) that are currently under 
investigation by the Office for Civil Rights.

We plan to improve the work done in this study and look at aspects of data breaches that they couldn't. Some of our 
ideas include: using the date of breach to understand trends in data breaches and aggregating by more than one level
(state, location and type of breach) to understand more about the nature of data breaches in this country.

We two hypotheses that we want to verify:

Hypothesis 1: Data breaches increase during the holiday season

Hypothesis 2: States with higher population have more data breaches
